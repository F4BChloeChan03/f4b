<h3>HELLO!</h3>
	<p>I am Chloe Chan.</p>
<p>My name is Chloe Chan. I am a F4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section). I am 16 years old. I have been studying is this school for 9 years, and I am a reading enthusiast. I have joined Chinese club this year. I volunteer to be the secondary librarian in this scholastic year. It would be a joy for me to stay with the books in the library. I want to study History in the University of Macau. I wish to be a historian in the future.</p>
